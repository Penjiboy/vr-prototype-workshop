  <!--
      This is the storyboard template translated to the 3D space.
      The default camera position (where the eyes rest) is at 1.6meters which
      will put the user height to roughly around 1.7meters. This can be
      modified to suit your scene if you need.

      Since putting the planes that define the zones at 0 will be too low to
      actually see the zones, you will have to move it up to your eye level or
      a bit lower to get a feel for the space.

              Test Object Placement Here
              Below, you can play with object placement in the 3D space and
              it affects your visual field.

              Try moving the chair from a distance of -0.5 to -20meters.
              How would you move the chair distance from your camera position
              and also put the chair in the visual field?
        -->

        <!-- <a-collada-model
            id="bounce-chair"
            src="../assets/3D/bounceChair.dae"
            position="0 0 0">
        </a-collada-model> -->

        <!--
              Now, move the planes down and try placing the human and the
              chair in different positions and play around with scale of the
              objects. How does it effect your experience?

              Using a human figure as a reference in your scenes is a great
              way to get approximate scales on your 3D models as we can
              visualize much better with relative scale than approaching 3D
              space blindly.
